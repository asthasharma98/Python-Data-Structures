## Set

This IPython notebook contains the basic concepts of sets in python like how to create sets and what are the different operations that can be performed on sets.

`Set` is collection of different elements.

**Properties of set :**

- Set elements are `Unordered` - Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
- Sets are `immutable` - we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
- Set does `not allow duplicate values`.
- Sets elements cannot be accessed by index or key.


Some built-in methods in python that we can apply on Set

|  **Method**        |   **Description**                                                        |
| -----------------  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------    |
| **add()**          | Adds an element to the set                                               |
| **clear()**        | Removes all the elements from the set                                    |
| **copy()**         | Returns a copy of the set                                                |
| **pop()**          | Removes an random element from the set                                   |
| **remove()**       | Removes the specified element                                            |
| **union()**        | Return a set containing the union of sets                                |
| **intersection()** | Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets                |
| **difference()**   | Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets         |
| **isdisjoint()**   | Returns boolean value whether two sets have a intersection or not        |
| **issubset()**     | Returns boolean value whether another set contains this set or not       |
| **issuperset()**   | Returns boolean value whether this set contains another set or not       |
