## Tuple

A tuple is a collection of objects which are immutable and ordered. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses(), whereas lists use square brackets[].

This IPython notebook contains the basic concepts of Tuple in python like :
- how to create tuples
- how to access the elements of tuples
- slicing of tuples
- concatination of tuples
- how we can loop through a tuple

set of built-in methods in python that we can apply on tuples
