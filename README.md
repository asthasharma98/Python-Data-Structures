## Python Inbuilt Data Structures

This repository contains the concept of different inbuilt python data structures and their working in the form of Ipython notebook created for learning purpose.


- [List](https://github.com/asthasharma98/Python-Inbuilt-Data-Structures/blob/main/List/List.ipynb) - *A list in python is a one-dimensional, Mutable and Ordered collection of elements.*                
- [Dictionary](https://github.com/asthasharma98/Python-Inbuilt-Data-Structures/blob/main/Dictionary/Dictionary.ipynb) -*Dictionary in python is Mutable and Unordered colletion of data values which is used to store data values in {key:value} pairs.*
- [Tuple](https://github.com/asthasharma98/Python-Inbuilt-Data-Structures/blob/main/Tuple/Tuple.ipynb) - *A tuple is a collection of objects which are immutable and ordered.* 
-  [Sets](https://github.com/asthasharma98/Python-Inbuilt-Data-Structures/blob/main/Sets/Set.ipynb) - *Set is collection of different elements which are unordered, immutable and unique.*
